Note to backporters: the dependency on perl 5.14 is needed in order to
produce an Architecture: all package consistently. If backporting to a
target with perl 5.12 or lower, change the Architecture of
libdevel-globaldestruction-perl back to any, and invert the sense of
the perl versioned dependencies. See also the 0.04-2 changelog.
